# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please keep in mind, this service is self-hosted, paid for, and can be monitored by our website (expected feature).
This means that version updates will be required, along with manual updates.
Don't worry, all data is self-hosted through internal files, therefore you can easily export and import data!

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.X   | :white_check_mark: | - EOL expected by the end of 2024. Support for 2.0.X soon after.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting a vulnerability is a big deal. Our developers continue to work constantly on our project.
Therefore, reporting a vulnerability should only be done if you have PROOF AND HAVE TESTED MULTIPLE TIMES. It could slow down our development process!
